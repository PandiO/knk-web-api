# Bundled FormConfiguration seeds (KNG-138)

One portable `knk-formconfig/1` file per configuration, named `{EntityTypeName}.json` (or a more specific
name such as `SiegeScenarioDistrict.join.json`). The API lists them at `GET api/FormConfigurations/seeds` and
imports one on request with `POST api/FormConfigurations/seeds/{name}/import?dryRun=&makeDefault=` (the web app's
"Import / seeds" panel on the form configuration list). There is no startup seeder.

- Import never overwrites: a file whose `configurationGuid` is already in the database writes nothing. To ship a
  changed seed, give it a new `configurationGuid` and name.
- A seed becomes the entity's default only when the entity has none, or when "make default" is asked.
- Join entries and child forms must be imported before the configurations that refer to them
  (`subConfigurationRef`), and before validation rules whose `dependsOn` names another configuration.
- Every file here should pass the dry run in a test (see `FormConfigurationSeedFilesTests`).
